Twitter itself offers to help you figure out whom to follow based on your described interests, but the results are driven by an algorithm (which always seem to include Justin Bieber).  In contrast FlockTamer is curated and edited by a passionate consumer of news.",

FlockTamer is real time information on areas of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a user you have the option of selecting 5 topics or to use the template created by the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the ability to change your areas of interest at any time or to switch between template and custom. &nbsp;&nbsp;You will gain the ability to be up to fully informed in less than 30 seconds or dive deeper if you wish. &nbsp;If you leave the site open it will update on a schedule that is useful but not overwhelming. &nbsp;All of this controllable from either a desktop browser or a browser on your smartphone.",
